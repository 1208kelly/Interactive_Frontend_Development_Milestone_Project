# Simon Memory Game 

Hi, my name is Rob and this is my Interactive Frontend Development Project. For this project
I have recreated the Simon memory game, complete with interactive functionality to play and try
to win the game.
This game is complete with flashing buttons with audio and a round counter to keep track of score.
 
## UX

This site is designed for anyone just looking for a quick game or brain exercise e.g anyone on a break at work or 
on a train or bus journey could easily load this up and play a quick game, so long as the user had some sort of
internet connection to access the site, of course.

It could also be used as reference for anyone learning to code, as an example of how JS can be implemented to make 
your code interactive and fun.

I used an image of a Simon game unit, sourced through Google, as a frame of reference for building my HTML/CSS shell.
This image file is located in the images folder in this project.

I used [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com/lp-home?msclkid=b4972eb141a5103b174571a658f204f1&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=UK%20Branded%20-%20E&utm_term=tailor%20brands&utm_content=S_Tailor%20Brands%20UK%20-%20E)
to aid in the creation of the brand logo.
I used audio sourced from [SoundJay.com](https:www.soundjay.com/index.html).

I also refered to various FAQ and tutorials on [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) and also 
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/) and tutorials on Youtube when Tutor support was unavailable or could not assist further.

I refered to this [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ) from 52:15 for help.


## Features

The features of this project are pretty simplistic but more designed to demonstarate how JavaScript can take a well designed 
or structured project or site and add a level of interactivity for the end user that makes their experience more enjoyable and memorable (excuse the pun).

I have recreated the memory game, Simon, and incorporated the start button to start up the unit and also a counter so the player can keep track of what round they 
are on, if they are keeping score.
 
### Features Left to Implement
- Other features that I have seen online, but that I have yet to implement in this project, would be a hard mode button. This would enable the user to play the game and if 
they get one wrong anwer they lose the game and have to start from round one all over again.

## Technologies Used

To create this project I did not use any templates as I wanted to build the majority of the HTML and CSS myself to get the dimensions of the unit acurate.

For the JavaScript I referenced from questions asked in sites like Stackoverflow and W3schools. For example, (and I have commented this in my js file) I was 
having trouble getting the buttons to light up in a random sequence so found a tutorial on [Stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array) 
and this along with assistence from my mentor got the buttons to light up correctly for me.
I also used part of a Youtube tutorial to help me with the round counter number to count up correctly and match up with the players round. [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ).

## Testing

To test this project I have checked my code using the [W3 Markup Caidation Service](http://validator.w3.org/) along with [jshint](https://jshint.com/).

I have adjusted my project so that it has a smooth appearance across the board on computer and tablet or mobile screens. 

I am quite happy with how this project turned out but I have had an issue that, due to time constraints and issues with my computer setting me back and 
therefore trying to catch up in my course work, I will have to address at a later date. This is issue is that upon the player getting the sequence wrong, 
the players input is then not recognised. I have reached out to tutor support for help with this issue but I was passed to about 4 different advisors and 
none of them could actually find the cause and therefore help me with my issue so I had to move on. I have made a note to look into this as I understand that 
bug fixing is big part of a competent developers role and I will need this knowledge going forward.

## Deployment

I have deployed my project using Github Pages at this [Github Pages project link:](https://1208kelly.github.io/Interactive_Frontend_Development_Milestone_Project/)

- I was inspired to choose this memory game from watching some Python and JS games created on websites and in tutorials.
